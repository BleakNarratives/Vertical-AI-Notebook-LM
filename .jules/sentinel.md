## 2026-04-25 - [Security Header Implementation & Sentinel Guard]
**Vulnerability:** Lack of defense-in-depth headers and unvalidated agent interaction triggers.
**Learning:** In an immersive environment like 'Code City', client-side triggers and recursive loops (Molt) can be exploited if not monitored. Next.js defaults lack aggressive security headers (CSP, etc.) which are critical for terminal-like UIs that might render dynamic content.
**Prevention:** Always implement robust security headers in `next.config.ts` and provide a dedicated security hook (`useSentinel`) to log and monitor application events.
